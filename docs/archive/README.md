## Why Archive?

These documents served their purpose during active development and test implementation. They contain valuable historical context but were creating documentation sprawl (6 test-related files in root).

The current [TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md) consolidates all active testing information into a single, maintainable document.

## Historical Value

Keep these files for:
- Understanding the test implementation process
- Learning from the failure analysis (TEST_FAILURE_INSIGHTS.md)
- Historical record of how quality was achieved
- Reference for similar projects
