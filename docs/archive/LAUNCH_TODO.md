## Recommended Launch Sequence

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (1-2 hours)
1. Fix module path (Critical #2)
2. Create GitHub repository (Critical #1)
3. Push code to GitHub
4. Create v1.0.0 tag and release (Critical #3, #4)
5. Test installation works (Important #6)
6. Add basic GitHub templates (Important #7)

### Phase 2: Launch Day
1. Post announcement to Hacker News (Show HN)
2. Post to r/golang on Reddit
3. Post to r/selfhosted on Reddit
4. Monitor comments and respond quickly
5. Fix any immediate installation issues
6. Track engagement and feedback

### Phase 3: Post-Launch (First Week)
1. Respond to all issues and questions
2. Merge any quick-win PRs
3. Add CI/CD if project gains traction
4. Consider adding badges and demo
5. Submit to Go Weekly if momentum is good
6. Write post-mortem/lessons learned

---

## Launch Metrics to Track

- [ ] GitHub stars (target: 50+ in first week)
- [ ] Issues opened (shows engagement)
- [ ] Successful installations reported
- [ ] HN/Reddit upvotes and comments
- [ ]go install download count (pkg.go.dev shows this after ~24hrs)

---

## Blockers and Risks

**Known Issues:**
- None currently identified

**Potential Risks:**
- Installation issues on different platforms (mitigate: test on Linux/macOS/Windows)
- Module path conflicts (mitigate: verify path is available)
- Security concerns raised (mitigate: reference security features in README)

---

## Notes

- All critical tasks must be completed before any public announcement
- Important tasks should be done before launch for best first impression
- Nice-to-have tasks can be done post-launch based on community response
- Keep this document updated as tasks are completed
