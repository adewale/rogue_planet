# Rogue Planet Configuration Example
#
# This file demonstrates all available configuration options.
# Copy this to your planet directory and customize as needed.
#
# Format: Standard INI with [sections] and key = value pairs
# Lines starting with # are comments

[planet]
# Required: Your planet's name (appears in page title and header)
name = My Planet

# Required: Your planet's URL (used for absolute links)
# Example: https://planet.example.com
link = https://example.com

# Optional: Planet owner information (appears in footer and feeds)
owner_name = Your Name
owner_email = you@example.com

# Output directory for generated HTML files
# Default: ./public
output_dir = ./public

# Number of days of entries to show
# Default: 7
# Tip: Increase for slower-moving planets (14-30 days), decrease for high-volume (3-5 days)
days = 7

# Logging verbosity: debug, info, warn, error
# Default: info
# Use "debug" for troubleshooting feed parsing or HTTP issues
log_level = info

# Number of feeds to fetch concurrently
# Default: 5
# Range: 1-50
# Tip: Higher values fetch faster but use more network connections
concurrent_fetches = 5

# HTTP User-Agent header sent when fetching feeds
# Default: RoguePlanet/0.1
# Best practice: Include your planet URL for feed owners to contact you
#   user_agent = RoguePlanet/0.3 (+https://planet.example.com/about)
user_agent = RoguePlanet/0.3

# Group entries by date in the output
# Default: true
# When true, shows "Today", "Yesterday", date headers
# When false, shows flat chronological list
group_by_date = true

# Custom theme template (optional)
# If not specified, uses built-in default theme
# Examples:
#   template = ./themes/classic/template.html
#   template = ./themes/elegant/template.html
#   template = ./themes/dark/template.html
#   template = ./themes/flexoki/template.html
# See examples/themes/ for available themes

# ENTRY SPAM PREVENTION (v0.3.0+)
# Prevents timeline flooding when adding feeds with large archives

# Filter entries by discovery date instead of published date
# Default: false
# When true, only shows entries discovered within the last N days
# When false (default), shows entries published within the last N days
# Use case: Add a feed with 100 historical posts but only show recent discoveries
filter_by_first_seen = false

# Sort entries by "published" date or "first_seen" date
# Default: published
# Options: published, first_seen
# - "published": Traditional behavior, entries sorted by author's publish date
# - "first_seen": Stable ordering, entries never move when authors update them
# Use case: Prevent entries from "jumping" in your timeline when authors edit posts
sort_by = published

[database]
# SQLite database path
# Default: ./data/planet.db
# The database stores feed metadata, HTTP cache headers, and entries
path = ./data/planet.db

# USAGE EXAMPLES
#
# Example 1: High-volume planet (show 3 days, sort by discovery)
#   days = 3
#   sort_by = first_seen
#   filter_by_first_seen = true
#
# Example 2: Slow-moving planet (show 30 days, traditional sorting)
#   days = 30
#   sort_by = published
#   filter_by_first_seen = false
#
# Example 3: Custom theme
#   template = ./themes/classic/template.html
#
# Example 4: Debug feed parsing issues
#   log_level = debug
#   concurrent_fetches = 1
#
# Example 5: Fast fetching for many feeds
#   concurrent_fetches = 20
